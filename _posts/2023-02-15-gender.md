When I say or exclaim "gender," it can be short for:

> "You've witnessed my performance of gender as I intended."

For example:

> Yay, gender!

Gender is a performance meant to indicate to others certain social traits or expectations.
Sometimes it is chosen by yourself, other times, by the "audience."

I came up with this shorthand to express to myself and others that things went well.

The way I perceive you can change based on how you perceive my gender,
so I prefer to let you expose your perception first before I sway it, if ever.
